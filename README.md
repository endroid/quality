# Endroid Quality

Library for quality assurance in PHP / Symfony projects.

## Guidelines

* One set of supported versions over all packages.
* Always support the latest Symfony and PHP versions.
  * When needed this means dropping support for older versions.
  * I.e. Symfony 8.x only works with PHP 8.4 and higher.
